This is a resource pack for the mod [Embers Rekindled](https://modrinth.com/mod/embers) that retextures some blocks and items from the mod to (in my opinion) improve them and make them fit better with Minecraft's modern textures. I plan to eventually rexture most of the sprites from the mod as I personally see fitting. If I do not believe I can improve the texture, I'll leave it as it is.

This pack currently only supports the 1.20.1 version though I may add support for 1.12.2 in the future.
